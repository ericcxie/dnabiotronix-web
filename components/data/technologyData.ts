      "For 20 years people have been aiming to utilize single-molecule electronic systems for sensing and electronic functions. ",
    paragraph2:
      "However, these capabilities have never been translated into products because of the difficulty of large-scale integration of single-molecule devices. Our approach represents the first, reliable approach for creating single-molecule electronic devices at scale.  Our current yields are ~100x greater than previous approaches.",
    paragraph3:
      "The DNA transistor represents an “Agnostic Diagnostic” tool. The chemical flexibility of DNA will allow modification with a range of known receptors capable of binding specific target analytes.",
